# website
This README is for my application website for Founders & Coders!


Ideas:
I would like to create a one page website with a navigation bar at the top, dark mode, and an image carousel.
I used w3school, what I had learned from freecodecamp, gregors image carousel demonstration, youtube and google.

Navbar: at first my nav bar hid/blocked the other tabs and revealed them when you clicked on them.
While this was fun to impliment, it didn't give the desired effect I was looking for.

I made a menu bar, and quickly found it didn't work as desired on mobile, thus learning about a burger menu.
I couldn't quite get my initial desired effect to bring up a side menu, so I had a thought that i could use the burger menu as a scroll to the top/reveal menu button, which I thought worked really well.

On future projects I would like to impliment this.

Garden Image Carousel
This will be a slideshow of pictures of my Garden It will automatically cycle through the images and there will be controls to stop the slideshow and progress backwards and forwards. 
Over lockdown, I redesigned my garden. I feel Garden design has many simularities to coding. Creating plans for the
layout and planting (writing the code), while removing the weeds(bugs). While this can be challenging, seeing your work
blossom over time makes it worth it.ðŸŒ¸

Gregors live coding session taught me how to build this, unfortunaley we ran out of time and I had to learn how to make the previous/next button work, which was very fun to learn.

I would have liked to have added dots to be able to switch between the photos, and also to have stylised the container and buttons better.
